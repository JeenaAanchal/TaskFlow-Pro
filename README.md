Tooling Vite, ESLint Styling Tailwind CSS (or add here if used) Icons lucide-react Linting ESLint with TypeScript, React Hooks, React Refresh plugins Build Vite State Mgmt React hooks or context (if applicable)

🔀 Smart Assign When a new task is created: The system evaluates user workload. Assigns the task to the user with the least number of open tasks.

⚔️ Conflict Handling When two users try to update the same task:

Each task has a version timestamp.

The system compares client and server versions.

If a conflict is found, the user is prompted to merge or overwrite.
